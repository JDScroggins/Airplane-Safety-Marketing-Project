# Airplane-Safety-Marketing-Project
### This project explored the different marketing techniques for a campaign to promote airline safety using data.

### Premise

### There were four means of communicating this message:

### Dashboard
-	An internal dashboard was created for fellow employees to see the data that would be used for the campaign and prepare to show to executives, before getting the message to the public. 

### Executive Presentation
-	A presentation was then made for the executives to show what message was going to be sent to the public and to reassure the executives that the industry is moving forward in a positive way.

### Blog post
-	https://whatdothestatssay.blogspot.com/ is a blog post that was created to begin to get the word out to the public about the safety of air travel compared to auto travel. 

### Infographic

-	An infographic was created as another way to reach a lot of people and get the message out. 
### Video
